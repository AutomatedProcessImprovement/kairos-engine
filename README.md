PrCore is a backend application used for prescriptive process monitoring. 
It takes historical event log files and provides ongoing case prescriptions based on the received event streaming data. 
It is flexible and can be applied to event logs in various domains. 
Its prescribing and predicting algorithms can be easily modified, replaced, or added due to its plugin mechanism. 
The system is designed to be scalable and can be deployed in a distributed environment.
